                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a graduate student in Computer Engineering at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering,
                    specializing in <strong>Applied AI systems</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, and
                    <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP) / SLM / LLM Research</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical foundation was forged during my undergraduate studies, where I co-founded the startup
                    <strong>InGelt</strong>. In that role, I applied hands-on expertise in <strong>Systems
                        Design</strong>, <strong>Web Technologies</strong>, <strong>Cloud</strong>, and
                    <strong>DevOps</strong> to build and scale a real-world product.

                    <p>
                        I'm driven by the challenge of making AI systems that actually work in the real world—not just
                        in research papers. Whether it's helping small businesses adopt machine learning or building
                        tools that turn weeks of research into hours, I want to bridge the gap between cutting-edge
                        models and practical impact. My work comes from the belief that the best technology is the kind
                        that solves real problems for real people, not just impressive benchmarks.
